# DigitalMusicProject
This is a Python program to translate Google Form data into a matrix to be processed by graph visualization software, Gephi.

The original survey asked about concertgoers' activities at live music events.

Notes:
Some outliers from the survey results were removed when analyzing the file such as nodes with an insignificant number of participants. The original csv file was reformatted before being used with the code.
